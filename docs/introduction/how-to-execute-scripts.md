# How to Execute ExtendScript in Premiere Pro

Executing scripts from within CEP panels is the recommended approach.

With additional configuration work, it’s also possible to pass scripts to Premiere Pro on a command line. This is not recommended, as behavior varies across platforms, and preliminary configuration is necessary before such execution is enabled.

Use VSCode with Adobe’s extension for development and debugging; for deployed workflows, stick with panels whenever possible.
