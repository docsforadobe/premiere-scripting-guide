# Premiere Pro Scripting Guide

This reference is a public compendium of information about the methods and members available via the API.

Premiere Pro provides an ExtendScript-based API, allowing for broad control of the entire application. ExtendScript can access and manipulation of most project elements, including metadata, exporting and rendering options.

Adobe wants your integration to succeed; please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:dmcsween@adobe.com?subject=API_Question_From_Docs) with questions, problems, or feature requests.

## 3rd Party Scripting is Moving to UXP

Before you go any further, though, know that Adobe is moving away from Extendscript, and to UXP - Unified Extensibility Platform. The API and a sample panel can be found here [Premiere Pro UXP API] (https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)

Although Extendscript will be supported at least through the end of 2025, no updates will be made to the API. 
## Navigating the Guide

If you're not sure where to start, take a look at the [Overview](./introduction/extendscript-overview.md) for how scripting works in Premiere Pro, or the [Changelog](./introduction/changelog.md) for updates to the scripting API over time.
