# Premiere Pro Scripting Guide

This reference is a public compendium of information about the methods and members available via the ExtendScript API.

Premiere Pro's ExtendScript-based API allows for broad control of the entire application. ExtendScript can access and manipulate most project elements, including metadata, exporting and rendering options.

Adobe wants your integration to succeed; please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:bbb@adobe.com?subject=ExtendScript_API_Question_From_Docs) with questions, problems, or feature requests.

## 3rd Party Scripting has moved to UXP

As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP; Unified Extensibility Platform. Have a look at the [API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/), and [sample plugins](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples/)

ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026.

## Navigating the Guide

If you're not sure where to start, take a look at the [Overview](./introduction/extendscript-overview.md) for how scripting works in Premiere Pro, or the [Changelog](./introduction/changelog.md) for updates to the scripting API over time.
